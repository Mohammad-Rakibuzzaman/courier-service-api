# courier-service-api

## Project Installation

* First of all created a virtual environment and then install all the necessary packages:

```
pip install django djangorestframework djangorestframework-simplejwt
```

* Now created the project file: 
```
django-admin startproject courier-service-rest
```
Inside of the project folder create an app called package_tracker:

```
py manage.py startapp package_tracker 
```

now move on to the settings.py file and add app and rest apis: [settings.py](https://prnt.sc/XdvsFz_AhrUU).

* I have also added a .gitignore file to ignore our venv or virtual environment file for further necessity.
